# Tea Website using HTML and CSS
This website was designed as part of Code Institute's Challenge Week 2022, where I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The website is showing how to make tea, using lists, icons and different coloured fonts.

The contents of this project are a HTML file and a CSS file. Open both files to have the website function correctly.
